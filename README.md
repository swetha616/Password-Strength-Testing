# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project evaluates the strength of different passwords using online password strength checkers. It analyzes the results, explains why some passwords are stronger than others, and outlines best practices for creating secure passwords. The report also covers common password attack methods such as brute force and dictionary attacks.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
1. Created five passwords of varying complexity:
   - Very Weak â†’ Weak â†’ Good â†’ Strong â†’ Very Strong
2. Tested each password using an online password strength tool.
3. Recorded scores, ratings, and tool feedback.
4. Analyzed the results and extracted best practices.
5. Researched common password attacks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

| Password         | Strength Rating | Tool Feedback |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| `pass1`          | Very Weak       | Too short, lacks complexity |
| `test12`         | Weak            | Needs uppercase and symbols |
| `password123`    | Weak / Medium   | Contains common word, predictable |
| `ASDFGHJKL;'`    | Strong          | Long, includes uppercase & symbols, lacks lowercase/numbers |
| `@Artist23Here!` | Very Strong     | Long, includes all character types |

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices Learned
- Use at least **12â€“16 characters**.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.
- Use random combinations rather than meaningful phrases.
- Donâ€™t reuse passwords across accounts.
- Consider using a **password manager**.

---

## ðŸ›¡ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** â€“ Tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack** â€“ Uses lists of common passwords and words to guess quickly.
